# SPEAK UP: A web platform that allows individuals to anonymously report incidents of Sexual- and Gender-Based Violence. #

SPEAK UP was a project by a group of the 2023 Fellows from a Training organized by _Webfala Digital Skills For All Initiative_ (WDSFAI) in collaboration with _The Circle_ tagged "SafeHer: STEM Skills to Combat SGBV". It was a digital skills training organized to equip women with digital skills in a bid to combat Sexual- and Gender-based Violence.

This project showcases a web-based platform that provides a safe and confidential space for individuals to anonymously report incidents of Sexual- and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) and also offers a comprehensive range of support services and resources tailored to survivorsâ€™ needs such as counseling, legal assistance, medical support and advocacy to help navigate the path to healing and recovery. It was built by a team of extraordinary ladies (see pictures below) consisting of Software Developers and Product Designers. You are welcome to view and constructive criticisms are welcome!
